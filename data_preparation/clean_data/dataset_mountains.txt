i O

the O

i O
never O
get O
tired O
of O
looking O
at O
cascade B-MON

whenever O
i O
m O
in O

it O
s O
the O
mountain O
directly O
north O
of O
the O

driving O
to O

from O

i O
always O
love O
seeing O
the O

cascading O
down O
the O

i O
think O
my O
view O
of O

here O
is O
better O
than O
the O

here O
we O
see O
a O
more O
interesting O
view O
i O
think O
from O
a O
little O
closer O
up O
but O
for O
some O
reason O
i O
don O
t O
get O
as O
excited O
by O

as O
i O
do O

and O
some O
of O
the O
annapurnas I-MON
even O
higher O
while O
