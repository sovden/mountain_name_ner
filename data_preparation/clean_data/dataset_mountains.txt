created O
a O

Annapurna I-MON
commands O

Its O

are O
a O

The O

the O

Fortunately O
it O

fortunate O
that O

so O
far O
I O
have O
visited O
many O

but O
the O
ones O
which O
attracts O
me O
are O
Mount O
Fuji I-MON
in O
Japan O
like O
100 O

drive O
from O

Tokyo O
and O
second O
one O
is O
Mount O
Kailash I-MON
in O

I O
feel O

to O
say O
that O
whatever O
mountain O
you O
re O
gazing O
at O
or O
climbing O
or O
skiing O
down O
at O
the O
moment O
is O
THE O
most O
beautiful O

right O
then O
and O
there O
How O
can O
one O
have O
a O
favorite O
child O

or O
mountain O
This O
was O
a O
great O
posting O
Lola O
and O
thanks O
for O
the O

mountains O
far O

wide O
I O
hope I-MON
we O
all O
have O
a O
Peak O

in O
2021 O

I O
haven O
t O
had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
see O
the O
Matterhorn I-MON
but O
would O
agree O
when O
Mt O
Rainier I-MON
is O
in O
it O
s O
glory O
their O
is O
nothing O
like O
it O
Just O
two O
weeks O

on O
a O
clear O
day O
at O

I O
caught O
several O
photos O
from O
Seattle O
The O
colors O
were O
magnificient O
I O
too O
needed O
a O

today O
Thank O
you O
Lola O

I O
like O
seeing O
Mt O

when O
I O
m O
driving O
North O
on O
I O
5 O
Tells O
me O
I O
m O
getting O
close O
to O
the O
Oregon O
border O

I O
ll O
also O
add O
the O
Grand O
Tetons O
although O
that O
is O
more O
of O
a O
range O
and O
not O
just O
one O
peak O

I O
need O
a O
lift O
today O
and O
thought O
I O
would O
start O
a O
conversation O
about O
beautiful O
mountains O
The O
thought O
was O
triggered O
by O
a O
photo O
of O
the O
Matterhorn I-MON
that O
came O
in O
an O
email O
from O
a O
travel O
company O
I O
have O
heard O
the O
Matterhorn O
described O
as O
the O
most O
beautiful O
mountain O
in O
the O
world O
and O
having O
been O
privileged O
to O
see O
her O
up O
close O
for O
several O
consecutive O
days O
while O
hiking O
around O
Zermatt O
I O
might O
agree O
The O
shape O
is O
graceful O
and O
unforgettable O

I O
never O
get O
tired O
of O
looking O
at O
Cascade B-MON
Mountain I-MON
whenever O
I O
m O
in O
Banff O
It O
s O
the O
mountain O
directly O
north O
of O
the O
town O
Driving O
to O
Banff O
from O
Calgary O
I O
always O
love O
seeing O
the O
waterfalls O
cascading O
down O
the O
mountain O
from O
spring O
runoff O

I O
think O
my O
view O
of O
Mt O
Rainier I-MON
from O
down O
here O
is O
better O
than O
the O
view O
from O
Seattle O
which O
looks O
like O
a O
big O
vanilla O
ice O
cream O
cone O
Here O
we O
see O
a O
more O
interesting O
view O
I O
think O
from O
a O
little O
closer O
up O
But O
for O
some O
reason O
I O
don O
t O
get O
as O
excited O
by O
a O
big O
lone O
volcano O
as O
I O
do O
by O
a O
range O
of O
peaks O
like O
the O
Olympics O
from O
Seattle O

I O
thought O

Ama B-MON

as O
well O
It O
s O
on O
the O
main O

It O
s O
a O

peak O

I O
ve O
not O
been O
to O
Denali I-MON
but O
I O
ll O
agree O
Mt O
Rainier I-MON
is O
spectacular O
even O
from O
the O
rest O
stop O
just O
west O
of O
Vantage O
which O
is O
the O
first O
glimpse O
you O
get O
on O
I90 O

I O
ve O
not O
seen O
it O
in O

but O
I O
ve O
heard O
and O
read O
often O
that O
many O
consider O
Mt O
